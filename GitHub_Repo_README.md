CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Project

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship
The project covers data collection, data analysis, and visualization through 3 main tasks.

Tasks Overview


Task 1: Web Scraping
* Scraped data from [BooksToScrape](https://books.toscrape.com/)
* Extracted book details: title, price, and rating
* Built a dataset (books_data.csv) containing 1000 books
* Tools: requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas
Files:
* Task1_WebScraping.ipynb
* books_data.csv


Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Performed data exploration and analysis on books_data.csv
* Asked questions like:
a. What is the average price of books?
b. Which ratings are most common?
c. Which are the most expensive and cheapest books?
d. Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Files:
* Task2_EDA.ipynb


Task 3: Data Visualization
* Created meaningful visualizations to highlight insights:
* Price distribution (histogram)
* Rating distribution (bar chart & pie chart)
* Top 10 most expensive books (bar chart)
* Price vs rating (boxplot)
* Tools: matplotlib, seaborn

Files:
* Task3_DataVisualization.ipynb
